# Ikigai

Ikigai (ee-key-guy) is a Japanese concept that combines the terms iki, meaning “alive” or “life,” and gai, meaning “benefit” or “worth.”
When combined, these terms mean that which gives your life worth, meaning, or purpose. According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai. To find it often requires enquiry and ‘search of self’ – a search which is thought of as “a reason to get up in the morning”
